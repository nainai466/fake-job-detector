# 🕵️ Fake Job Detector – Pakistan Edition

A Machine Learning–powered Streamlit app that helps identify fake job postings, specifically designed to assist job seekers in Pakistan. This tool uses natural language processing and a logistic regression model to classify whether a job ad is potentially fraudulent or legitimate.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects fake job ads based on their text
- Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit
- Simple and easy-to-use web interface
- Pre-trained model included for instant deployment

## 🧠 How it Works

1. Load and clean the job postings dataset.
2. Train a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Logistic Regression model.
3. Input any job description via the app interface.
4. The model predicts whether it’s real or fake.
